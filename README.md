# Lanchester R&D - Scaffold

This repository contains a scaffold for a premium, minimal product strategy lab built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Next steps:

- Install dependencies (see commands below).
- Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.

Installation

1. Install production dependencies:

```bash
npm install next react react-dom framer-motion tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer typescript
```

2. Install dev dependencies (types + Storybook):

```bash
npm install -D @types/react @types/node @storybook/nextjs @storybook/addon-essentials @storybook/addon-interactions @storybook/testing-library
```

3. Initialize Tailwind (if you didn't already run it):

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Run

```bash
# development Next.js app
npm run dev

# Storybook (component dev)
npm run storybook

# build production
npm run build
npm run start
```

Fonts:

- This scaffold uses the Inter font via `next/font/google` in `app/layout.tsx`.

Storybook:

- I can add Storybook next (component-driven dev setup). Let me know if you want it included now and I'll scaffold `/.storybook` and the necessary scripts.
Storybook:

1. Install Storybook dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D @storybook/nextjs @storybook/addon-essentials @storybook/addon-interactions @storybook/testing-library
```

2. Run Storybook (dev):

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This project includes a minimal `.storybook` config and example stories for `PageHero`, `ProjectCard`, and `MetricBlock`.
