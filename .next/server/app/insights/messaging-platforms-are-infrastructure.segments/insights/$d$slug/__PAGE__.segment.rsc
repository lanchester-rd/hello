These concerns matter where decisions depend on a record of communication or where actions are triggered by conversational cues.</p>\n\n<h4>Implementation principles</h4>\n<p>Instrument messages with deterministic metadata, define canonical export formats, and separate ephemeral UI concerns from the record layer. This separation prevents UI changes from corrupting the product’s ability to produce evidence.</p>\n\n<h4>Concluding note</h4>\n<p>Treating messaging as infrastructure reduces systemic friction and makes operationalisation of conversational products tractable.</p>\n"}}]]}],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/86eadbd902031b04.js","async":true}]],["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
