<p>Product roadmaps that prioritise feature delivery without explicit governance collapse under scale. Scale introduces complexity: multiple teams, divergent local requirements and operational constraints. Without rules for decision-making and escalation, the roadmap becomes a coordination burden rather than a guiding instrument.</p>

<h4>The structural failure</h4>
<p>At scale, the core issue is not prioritisation but alignment. Alignment requires explicit decision rights, a shared narrative for trade-offs and clarity about which metrics matter at which level. Roadmaps that lack these elements reduce clarity and amplify conflict.</p>

<h4>Architecting for scale</h4>
<p>Define a small set of governance rituals: regular prioritisation reviews with cross-functional representation, decision logs for trade-offs, and guardrails that constrain growth impulses. Use these mechanisms to keep the roadmap actionable and defensible.</p>

<h4>Practical steps</h4>
<p>Translate strategic bets into experiments with clear success criteria. Map teams to outcome areas and define escalation boundaries. This approach preserves the roadmap’s purpose while enabling local adaptation.</p>
